# Moka Project

The Moka Project is meant to be a graphics library / game engine, written in C++

This repository is a repo that contains submodules of different Moka modules, with dependency handling between them.

To compile it on Linux, run the `scripts/build.sh` shell script, which is a wrapper for some CMake commands.

It should compile fine on Windows and Mac, however it is not tested and Windows does not have an easy build script as of now.

Documentation is possibly coming soon.
